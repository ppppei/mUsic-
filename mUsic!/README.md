# mUsic!

- A Webpack-based music management application of sorts. Customize it of YOUR choice.    
- Implemented code splitting and combine it with file caching to dramatically decrease load times    
- Applied CommonChunkPlugin, HtmlWebpackPlugin and DefinePlugin to optimize automatic Webpack functions for both production and development builds. Added a clean function by running the rimraf
- Used webpack-dev-server to provide live reloading under development mode
